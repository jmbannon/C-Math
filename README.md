# C-Math
C-Math is a mathematics calculator written in C for the linux terminal. It is 
designed for those who are too lazy to dig up their TI-83 calculators and 
do not know the existence of Wolfram Alpha.  This project is meant to be a 
way for myself to familiarize with C and a variety of data structures to 
handle algebraic computations.
